Description: This project builds a machine learning model to predict home loan defaults, aimed at assisting a bankâ€™s consumer credit department in improving the decision-making process for home equity lines of credit. Following the Equal Credit Opportunity Act's guidelines, the goal is to create an empirically derived, statistically sound model for credit scoring based on recent applicant data. After thorough data preprocessing, several models were tested, with the Random Forest model on oversampled data showing the best performance by prioritizing recall and reducing bias in loan approvals. Key features influencing defaults were analyzed to guide effective business recommendations. 
Project deliverables include thorough EDA and Model Development using Python and Presentation of the solutions, recommendations and business case for deploying the suggested solution.
